♦ Introduction
The project is designed to help and guide people heading towards a wonderful
journey without any prior knowledge about location. As the name suggests, it’ll
help you to move just after your packing is done. Through this project, we want to
develop a platform for PacknGo.
♦ Why this Project exists?
 Already existing projects are more costly
 Lack of Proper management at Ticket Windows
 Sometimes guides do manipulate
♦ What we plan to do about it?
 Preparing online ticket booking which will provide a QR code after booking
thus reducing rush at ticket window. Further, scanning the QR code at
entry, reducing rush at entry point as well.
 Plotting short ranged routers after certain locations at tourist spot which is
less costly than headphones available or hiring guides.
 Fetching the IP address of routers to check the locations and thus phone
will automatically start addressing about the locations in that range, where
to move from that location, what is the significance of the same place.
♦ What we have done?
 We have designed a website which will fetch location, and tell you the
complete details about the place in an audio format. Along with that, it also
generates unique QR code at the time of ticket booking. 
♦ Contribution
 We need help to see our vision turn into reality. Any help, big or small, with
the code, idea, suggestion, feedback, typo, anything at all that you think
would be of help, is most welcome and much appreciated. If you’re
